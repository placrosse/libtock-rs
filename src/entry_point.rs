// _start and rust_start are the first two procedures executed when a Tock
// application starts. _start is invoked directly by the Tock kernel; it
// performs stack setup then calls rust_start. rust_start performs data
// relocation and sets up the heap before calling the rustc-generated main.
// rust_start and _start are tightly coupled: the order of rust_start's
// parameters is designed to simplify _start's implementation.
//
// The memory layout is controlled by the linker script and these methods. These
// are written for the following memory layout:
//
//     +----------------+ <- app_heap_break
//     | Heap           |
//     +----------------| <- heap_bottom
//     | .data and .bss |
//     +----------------+ <- stack_top
//     | Stack          |
//     | (grows down)   |
//     +----------------+ <- mem_start
//
// app_heap_break and mem_start are given to us by the kernel. The stack size is
// determined using pointer text_start, and is used with mem_start to compute
// stack_top. The placement of .data and .bss are given to us by the linker
// script; the heap is located between the end of .bss and app_heap_break. This
// requires that .bss is the last (highest-address) section placed by the linker
// script.

/// Tock programs' entry point. Called by the kernel at program start. Sets up
/// the stack then calls rust_start() for the remainder of setup.
